In React Native, when working with FlatList, a common issue arises when trying to render items dynamically fetched from an API.  If the data is not properly handled, or if there's a problem with data fetching, you might encounter errors that lead to unexpected behavior. For instance, improperly handling the loading state or errors during the fetch operation could result in a blank list or an application crash. Another less common issue occurs when using nested FlatLists. If not configured correctly, this can lead to performance issues and render problems, particularly when dealing with a large amount of data.  Incorrectly managing keys for components within the FlatList can also result in unexpected re-renders, leading to glitches or performance degradation.  Specifically, keys need to be unique across all items in the list.  Incorrect implementation of the `keyExtractor` prop can cause these issues. Finally, issues with data mutations can lead to incorrect rendering.  If data is being modified in a way that doesn't trigger re-renders correctly, inconsistencies in displayed information may result.
